[Mark Wunch](https://twitter.com/markwunsch) and [Casey Kolderup](https://twitter.com/ckolderup) recently started [Abstract Factory](http://www.abstractfactory.tv/), a podcast about technology, creativity, society, and the interactions between them. There's only been one episode so far, but it's got several things going for it: 

- It's short, so it's easy to fit in. This is [intentional](https://medium.com/p/735bf29eb06a):

    > Episode 1 of Abstract Factory is 26 minutes long. My hope is to never ship an episode longer than 30 minutes. I donâ€™t like long podcasts and I know that there are others like me.
- It's not a pair of talking heads. Both Mark and Casey have a specific viewpoint, but it feels more like a performance than a standard radio show. It reminded me of [Computer Anonymous](http://computeranonymous.org/).
- There's some great incidental music in it.
